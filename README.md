build_bitcoin
=============

This repository has a shell script named `build.sh`. On Debian Wheezy, it will:

 * install all dependencies nessesary to build the bitcoin client
 * clone the bitcoin repository
 * do all of the busywork of getting it compiled for the first time

It would probably work on Ubuntu too.
